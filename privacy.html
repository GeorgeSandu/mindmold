        <h3>How OneRoom Started</h3>
		<p> OneRoom started off as a group of friends brainstorming about a video game. They wanted a game that was immersive 
		and productive at the same time. The development started in September 2015, 
		in Dimitri Papigiotis's bedroom where George Sandu, Dimitri Papigiotis, and Jonathan Cali would work on
		game development. Later on Sanito Ricatto joined to help with development. Since the idea was finished, the first thing we had to do 
		was to design the maps and music. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		

        <h3>Building Blocks To Success</h3>
		<p> Designing the maps was the core of development, because it's what emphasizes 
		the purpose of the game being Memorization and Place Learning. "Place Learning" is a method 
		that exercises the brain's memorization tactics. This subconsciously trains the player for real life
			scenarios such as remembering directions and streets. Memorization is a key factor of responsibility, and MindMold 
			is a game that can train respectable traits as such.
			</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
		<p>The MindMold team used strategical thinking learned through internet research on place learning to implement map designs. 
		A splash screen showing players what they have to memorize is implemented for six or ten seconds. Falling tiles, pathways, and restarting 
		on death have also been recently implemented . Now the MindMold team makes more levels to focus on memorization as well as hand eye 
		coordination. Some more features implemented in Mindmold are the turrets and black bars in the level to make the game have an obstacle course feel. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Extra Creations</h3>
        <p>Music was added throughout the game, made using Logic Pro X for its production. MindMold also has a promotional website made 
		which highlights the key points of OneRoom's mission and also has a suggestions page. Another idea that was implemented in
		 MindMold was the black bars that were added to the game. The idea of the black bars were to add challenge to the player, and add 
		 hand eye coordination training as well as practicing memorization.</p>
